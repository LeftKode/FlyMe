# FlyMe
An app created with one of my classmates in the university. It is an app the uses APIs in order to receive data for flights that are 
available and meet the criteria the user entered. Those flights are presented to the user and include all the details a user needs
to know. It also includes an internal SQLite database which stores each search the user makes.

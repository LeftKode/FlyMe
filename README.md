# FlyMe
An app created with one of my classmates in the university. It is an app that uses APIs in order to receive data for available flights 
that meet the criteria the user entered. The data is received in JSON format, it is then parsed and presented to the user in a useful
and understandable way. It also features an internal SQLite database which stores each search the user makes. The 10 most recent searches
are retrieved from the database and are presented to the user in a list.
